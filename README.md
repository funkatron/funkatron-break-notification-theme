# Funkatron's Break Notification Theme

This project is a [`TimeOut`](https://www.dejal.com/timeout/) break theme designed to help remind you of your intent, and help you stay present. On each load, it presents a randomly selected piece of text that encourages mindfulness and intention.

Right now there are only two pieces of content, but it should be clear how it works.



This is very basic. I hope I can work on it more soon.
